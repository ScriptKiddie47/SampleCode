# Stack Memory

1. Memory where 
    - methods are executed
    - Argument passing
    - Local Variable Storage
1. Stack + Instruction pointer = State of each thread's execution
1. All variables belong to the thread executing on that stack
1. Stack size is fixed and relatively small


# Heap

1. All objects ( `new` operator)
    - String
    - Object
    - Collection

1. Members of classes
1. Static variables - 
1. Managed by GC
1. Objects stay as long as we have a reference
1. Static Variables - Stay Forever
1. References =! Objects

### Note 

1. References can be allocated on the stack
1. Can be allocated on the heap if they are members of a class

# Share Resource between threads

1. What is a resource
    - Variables ( Integers,Strings.. )
    - Data Strcuture
    - Files
    - Any objects

1. What is the problem of sharing resouces ?
1. Lets look at one code example. The premise is quite simple. We are in a wherehouse where we have multiple items which we count using a simple count attribute , increment & decrement function to adjust the no# of items.We also have 2 thread classes using which we increment and decrement as per our requirement.

```java
package org.example;

public class Main {
    public static class DecrementingThead extends Thread{
        private InventoryCountry inventoryCountry;
        public DecrementingThead(InventoryCountry inventoryCountry){
            this.inventoryCountry = inventoryCountry;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                inventoryCountry.decrement();
            }
        }
    }

    public static class IncrementingThead extends Thread{
        private InventoryCountry inventoryCountry;
        public IncrementingThead(InventoryCountry inventoryCountry){
            this.inventoryCountry = inventoryCountry;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                inventoryCountry.increment();
            }
        }
    }

    private static class InventoryCountry{
        private int items = 0;
        public void increment(){
            items++;
        }
        public void decrement() {
            items--;
        }
        public int getItems(){
            return items;
        }
    }

      public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        InventoryCountry inventoryCountry = new InventoryCountry();
        IncrementingThead incrementingThead = new IncrementingThead(inventoryCountry);
        DecrementingThead decrementingThead = new DecrementingThead(inventoryCountry);

        // Code added here will be mentioned below

        System.out.println("We currently have : " + inventoryCountry.getItems() + " items");

    }

}
```

1. So the 2 threads perform a single job.
1. Increment 10,000 items and decrement 10,000 items. We we run them syncronously 

    ```java
    incrementingThead.start();
    incrementingThead.join();

    decrementingThead.start()
    decrementingThead.join();
    ```

1. We get the output - `We currently have : 0 items` everytime which is expected
1. However if we run them in parallel

    ```java
    incrementingThead.start();
    decrementingThead.start();

    incrementingThead.join();
    decrementingThead.join();
    ```

1. We get varying results for every run.

    ```
    We currently have : -1157 items
    We currently have : -461 items
    We currently have : 48 items
    .
    ...
    ```

1. This is because inventoryCountry is a shared object.
    - items member is shared between 2 threads
    - Operations items++ & items-- are happening at the same time.
    - Operations items++ & items-- are not atomic operations


### Atomic Operation 

1. An operation or a set of operations is considered atomic, if it appears to the rest of the system s if it occurred at once.
1. Single step - "all or nothing'
1. No intermediate states
1. items++ is not an atomic operation. It can be divided into 3 ops
    - Get current value of items
    - Increment current value by 1
    - Store result in items variable

# Critical Scction
    - Function / method where concurrent access can cause harm to the code

## Synchronized 

1. Locking mechanism
1. Restrict access to critical section or entire method to a single thread at a time
1. 2 ways to use it
1. 1st way - Monitor
    - declare 1 or more method in a class as syncronized so when 1 or more threads call onto these methods only 1 thread will be able to execute only either of those methods in a class
    - For example if Thread A is excuted sync method 1 & but not sync method 2.
    - Thread B won't be able to touch both sync method 1 & 2.
    - This is because sync is applied per object 
    - The correct term would be monitor

    ```java
        private static class InventoryCountry{
        private int items = 0;
        public synchronized void increment(){
            items++;
        }
        public synchronized void decrement() {
            items--;
        }
        public synchronized int getItems(){
            return items;
        }
    }
    ```
    - this gives the correct output everytime we run it.

    ```
    We currently have : 0 items
    ```

1. 2nd Way - Lock
    - Define a sync block & define a object to sync on to restrict access only to it.
    - Any sync block which is sync on the same object will allow only 1 thread to executing inside our block
    - This lock offers us better oppurtunity in some cases
    - Only a small portion of the method would need to be sync , others can run cocurrent code

    ```java
        private static class InventoryCountry {
        private int items = 0;
        Object lock = new Object();

        public void increment() {
            synchronized (this.lock) {
                items++;
            }
        }

        public void decrement() {
            synchronized (this.lock) {
                items--;
            }
        }

        public int getItems() {
            synchronized (this.lock) {
                return items;
            }
        }
    ```

    - Sync block is Reentrant
    - A thread cannot prevent itself from entering a critical section

## Atomic Operations

1. All reference assignments are atomic.
1. We can get and set references to objects atomically.
1. All assignments to primitive types are safe expect `long` and `double`
    - That means reading and writing to the following types
    - int,short,byte,float,char,boolean

1. Long and Double are exception because they are 64 bit
    - Write will take 2 operatios

1. Thankfully java provides us with a solution 
    - `long` & `double` if declared volatile
    -  Volatile makes assignments to long atomic, however incrementing a volatile variable still involves multiple operations

1. Classes in the java.util.concurrent.atomic 
    - Provides more advanced operations

1. Lets look at a use case:
    - Metrics Aggregation
    - We will observe applications metrics. Duration of the operation and provide data to the customer.
    - We will create a metrics class where we will capture samples
    - A business class to simulate business logic
    - BusinessLogic will have access to Metrics


```java
public class ClientMain {

	/**
	 * We are interested in the average at any given moment. Average = total sum of
	 * all the samples divide by the number of samples.
	 * 
	 */
	public static class Metrics {
		private long count = 0;
		private volatile double average = 0.0;

		/**
		 * First we calculate the current total sum of all the samples. Then we increase
		 * the sample size by 1.
         *  Volatile makes assignments to long atomic, 
         * however incrementing a volatile variable still involves multiple operations
		 * 
		 * @param sample
		 */
		public synchronized void addSample(long sample) {
			double currentSum = average * count;
			count++;
			average = (currentSum + sample) / count;
		}

		public double getAverage() {
			return average;
		}
	}

	public static class BusinessLogic extends Thread {

		private Metrics metrics;
		private Random random = new Random();

		public BusinessLogic(Metrics metrics) {
			this.metrics = metrics;
		}

		/**
		 * Simulate Business Logic Here where thread sleeps a random number of
		 * milliseconds. Add duration to metrics
		 */
		@Override
		public void run() {
			while (true) {
				long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
				try { Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10)); } catch (InterruptedException e) { }
				long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
				metrics.addSample(end - start);
			}
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Will run parallel to our Business Logic. Capture duration & print to screen.
	 * Every 100 milliseconds capture the duration and print it to the console. As
	 * the below method is not synchronized we can guarantee it will run in
	 * parallel.
	 */
	public static class MetricsPrinter extends Thread{
		private Metrics metrics;

		public MetricsPrinter(Metrics metrics) {
			super();
			this.metrics = metrics;
		}

		@Override
		public void run() {
			while(true) {
				try { Thread.sleep(100); }catch (Exception e) { }
				double currentAverage = metrics.getAverage();
				System.out.println("Current Average is: " + currentAverage);
			}
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Metrics metrics = new Metrics();
		BusinessLogic businessLogict1 = new BusinessLogic(metrics);
		BusinessLogic businessLogict2 = new BusinessLogic(metrics);
		
		MetricsPrinter metricsPrinter = new MetricsPrinter(metrics);
		
		businessLogict1.start();
		businessLogict2.start();
		metricsPrinter.start();
	}
}
```

## Data Race - Problem

1. Compiler and CPU may execute the instructions out of order to optimze performance and utilization
1. They do so while maintaining the logical correctness of the code
1. The compiler re-arranges instruction for better
    - Branch prediction - Optimized Loop,If statements
    - Vectorization - Parallel instruction execution
1. CPU re-arranges instuction for better hardware units utilization
