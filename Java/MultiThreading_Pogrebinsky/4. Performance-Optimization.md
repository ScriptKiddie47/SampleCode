# Performance in Multithreading

1. Latency - The time to completion of a task
    - Theoretical reduction of latency by N = Performance improvement by a factor of N
    - N = ?
        - In general purpose N should be no. of cores.
        - Adding additional threads will impact performance.
        - Hyperthreading - Single physical core can run 2 threads at a time.
1. Throughput - The amount of tasks completed in a given period.

### Inherent Cost of Paralllization and Aggregation 

1. Breaking task into multiple tasks
1. Thread Creation , passing tasks to threads
1. Time between thread.start() to thread getting scheduled
1. Time until the last thread finishes and signals
1. Time until the aggregating thread runs

### Tasks

1. Not every tasks can be broken down into subtasks
1. Task can be classified in 3 types
    - Paralleliable Tasks
    - Unbreakable,Sequential 
    - Partially Parallelizable
