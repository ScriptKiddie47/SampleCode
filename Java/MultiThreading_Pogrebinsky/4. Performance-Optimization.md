# Performance in Multithreading

1. Latency - The time to completion of a task
    - Theoretical reduction of latency by N = Performance improvement by a factor of N
    - N = ?
        - In general purpose N should be no. of cores.
        - Adding additional threads will impact performance.
        - Hyperthreading - Single physical core can run 2 threads at a time.
1. Throughput - The amount of tasks completed in a given period.

### Inherent Cost of Paralllization and Aggregation 

1. Breaking task into multiple tasks
1. Thread Creation , passing tasks to threads
1. Time between thread.start() to thread getting scheduled
1. Time until the last thread finishes and signals
1. Time until the aggregating thread runs

### Tasks

1. Not every tasks can be broken down into subtasks
1. Task can be classified in 3 types
    - Paralleliable Tasks
    - Unbreakable,Sequential 
    - Partially Parallelizable

### Example

1. The example used by the tutorial has a high complexity. However we observed that multithread definately gives us a great advantage based on adequate thread allocation.

2. For reference the source code should be downloaded from Udemy Course.

# Throughput Performance 

1. Measured in Task/Time Unit.
1. Approaches to increase throughput in an application 
    - Approach 1 : Breaking Tasks into subtasks
    - Approach 2 : Running Tasks in parallel

## Thread Pooling

1. Reusing thread
1. Thread are created and they sit in the pool
1. Tasks are distributed among the threads through a queue
1. If all the threads a busy , task will wait
1. Implement a thread pool is completed.
1. JDK Comes with a few implementation of threa dpool.
1. By serving each task on a different thread, in parallel, we can improve throughput by 'N'
1. N = #threads = #cores
1. Using a Fixed Thread pool , we maintin a constant number of threads and eliminate the need to recreate the threads.
1. Significant perf improvement ( xN )


### Fixed Thead Pool Executor

1. Example here is an HTTP server
1. The code here is highly altered and shortened

```java
public class Main {

    private static final int NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 1;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        startServer(text);
    }

    private static void startServer(String text) throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Starting server at : " + 8080);
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
        server.createContext("/search", new WordCountHandler(text));
        Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUMBER_OF_THREADS);
        server.setExecutor(executor);
        server.start();
    }

    private static class WordCountHandler implements HttpHandler {
        @Override
        public void handle(HttpExchange httpExchange) throws IOException {
            String query = httpExchange.getRequestURI().getQuery();
            String[] keyValue = query.split("=");
            String action = keyValue[0];
            String word = keyValue[1];
            if (!action.equals("word")) {
                httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(400, 0);
                return;
            }
            long count = countWord(word);
            byte[] response = Long.toString(count).getBytes();
            httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length);
            OutputStream outputStream = httpExchange.getResponseBody();
            outputStream.write(response);
            outputStream.close();
        }
    }
}
```

1. For now just understand that we have created a HTTPServer with a executer with 1 thread.
1. We can do simple get requests on the application. Just understand for now we pass in some data with query params and it gives us a response


```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/search?word=talk
551
```

1. So we can now use Jmeter and run load test on our java app.
    - ps: I did some additonal sysout calls which slows the app a little. 
1. Throughput is #requests/#totalTime
1. So we are going to fire 2600 request from a 100 users. Out server is going to run on single thread i.e `private static final int NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 1`
    - 459.44 per second
    - If we increase the number of threads to 2
        - 893.47 per second
        - 
        ```bash
        Thread namepool-1-thread-2 Request : 2584
        Thread namepool-1-thread-1 Request : 2586
        ```
    - Thread to 4
        - 1316.4556962025315
        - 
        ```
        Thread namepool-1-thread-1 Request : 2542
        Thread namepool-1-thread-2 Request : 2543
        Thread namepool-1-thread-3 Request : 2544
        Thread namepool-1-thread-4 Request : 2545
        Thread namepool-1-thread-1 Request : 2546
        ```
1. So we see the awesome feature of multithreading here. Note : If we increase the number of threads the throughput remains the same so we have certain point which we need to stick to for best performance with requried resources.
