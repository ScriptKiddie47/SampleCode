# MultiThreading

## Threads
1. What does the thread contain ?
    - Stack
    - Instruction Pointer
1. What does a thread share ?     
    - Files
    - Heap
    - Code
1. In a multithreaded application each thread comes with its own stack.
1. So we need to tread carefully on apps which use stack data

## Context Switch

1. It is the 
    - Act of Stopping a thread 
    - Schedule it out
    - Schedule another thread
    - Starting another thread

2. They are not swtich & its the price we way for concurrency
3. Having too many threads can cause `thrashing` which means the OS will spend more time managing threads than real tasks
4. Theads consume less resources than processes.

## Theads Scheduling

1. Dynamic Priority - Performed by OS
2. Static Priortiy - Performed by Developer

### When to prefer Multi-Threaded Architecture

1. Prefer if tasks share a lot of data

### When to prefer Multi-Process Architecture

1. Security & Stability are of high importance
2. Tasks are unrelated to each other
3.
