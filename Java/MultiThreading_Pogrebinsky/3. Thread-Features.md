# Thread Features

## Thread Interrupt

1. Why & When ?
1. Thread consume - memory & kernel resource
1. If a thread finished its work, but the application is still running. We want to clean up the thread resources.
1. If a thread is misbehaving
1. Stop & Close the application gracefully.
1. Thread object has a method called interrupt.
1. Suppose we have 2 Threads ThreadA & ThreadB.
    - We can send a interrupt from ThreadA to interrupt ThreadB.
    - `Thread.interrupt()`
1. When can we Interrupt a thread ?
    - If the thread is executing a method that throws an interrupted Exception
    - If the thread we are trying to interrupt is handling the signal explicitly.

    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new BlockingTask());
            thread.start();
            System.out.println("Making main thread sleep for 5s");
            Thread.sleep(5000);
            thread.interrupt();
        }
        private static class BlockingTask implements Runnable{
            @Override
            public void run() {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Sleeping for 20000 ms");
                    Thread.sleep(20000);
                    System.out.println("Slept well for 20000 ms"); // Never executed as interrupt blocks the flow
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Exiting Blocking thread");
                }
            }
        }

    }
    ```

    ```
    Making main thread sleep for 5s
    Sleeping for 20000 ms
    Exiting Blocking thread
    ```

1. If we don't address the Interrupted Excption , the computation keeps on running!
1. Lets take the below example where we are printing fib numbers

    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new LongComputationTask(new BigInteger("200000"), new BigInteger("100000000")));
            thread.start();
            thread.interrupt();
        }
        private static class LongComputationTask implements Runnable {
            private BigInteger base;
            private BigInteger power;

            public LongComputationTask(BigInteger base, BigInteger power) {
                this.base = base;
                this.power = power;
            }

            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println(base + "^" + power + " = " + pow(base, power));
            }

            private BigInteger pow(BigInteger base, BigInteger power) {
                BigInteger result = BigInteger.ONE;

                for (BigInteger i = BigInteger.ZERO; i.compareTo(power) != 0; i = i.add(BigInteger.ONE)) {
                    result = result.multiply(base);
                }

                return result;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
1. The above code never gets interrupted and keeps of running even though we sent an interrupt command.
1. So what we can do is have a check in the code where most time based calculation are hapenning using `isInterrupted()`. If true stop calculation and return boi.

    ```java
    for (BigInteger i = BigInteger.ZERO; i.compareTo(power) != 0; i = i.add(BigInteger.ONE)) {
            if(Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()){
                System.out.println("Premature interrupted Computation");
                return BigInteger.ZERO;
            }
    ```

1. So we get the output : `200000^100000000 = 0`

# Daemon Threads

1. Threads that run in the backgroup and do no prevent our apps from exiting if the main thread terminates.
1. Applicable for Scenario's
    - Background tasks should not block our app from terminating
    - Code in worked thread is not in our control.
        - Worked controls external lib
1. Code - `thread.setDaemon(true);`
1. This seems a bit complicated to showcase.

## Thread Co-ordination - JOINS

1. If we run 2 threads seprately, we cannot predict the flow of exception.
1. What if ThreadA is dependent on ThreadB.
1. If we keep checking during ThreadA execution that ThreadB is completed before we start. But this is wastefull
1. Desired solution would be ThreadA goes to sleep while threadB completes it work. Once threadB is done. ThreadA wakes up
1. Lets do a facotrial calculation of some big number. Factorial Calculation is time consuming
1. The code is written in such a way that main thread checks if the factorial result is ready & print it. So there is a race condition. In Some cases result is not ready by the time main thread checks on it.

    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<Long> inputNumbers = Arrays.asList(0L,3435L, 35435L, 2324L, 4656L, 23L, 5556L);
            List<FactorialThread> threads = new ArrayList<>();

            for(long no : inputNumbers){ threads.add(new FactorialThread(no)); }
            for(Thread th : threads){ th.start(); }
            for (int i = 0; i < inputNumbers.size(); i++) {
                FactorialThread factorialThread = threads.get(i);
                if(factorialThread.isFinished()){
                    System.out.println("Factorial of " + inputNumbers.get(i) + " is " + factorialThread.getResult());
                }else{
                    System.out.println("Calculation of " + inputNumbers.get(i) + " is still in progress");
                }
            }
        }
        public static class FactorialThread extends Thread {
            private long inputNumber;
            private BigInteger result = BigInteger.ZERO;
            private boolean isFinished = false;

            public FactorialThread(long inputNumber) { this.inputNumber = inputNumber; }
            @Override
            public void run() {
                this.result = factorial(inputNumber);
                this.isFinished = true;
            }

            public BigInteger factorial(long n) {
                BigInteger tempResult = BigInteger.ONE;
                for (long i = n; i > 0; i--) {
                    tempResult = tempResult.multiply(new BigInteger((Long.toString(i))));
                }
                return tempResult;
            }
            public BigInteger getResult() { return result; }
            public boolean isFinished() { return isFinished; }
        }
    }
    ```

    ```
    Factorial of 0 is 1
    Calculation of 3435 is still in progress
    Calculation of 35435 is still in progress
    Factorial of 2324 is 821484071650481810568272005.....
    Calculation of 4656 is still in progress
    Factorial of 23 is 25852016738884976640000
    Calculation of 5556 is still in progress
    ```

1. So we observe in some cases before the new threads are able to comlete the computation main thread is asking for result.
1. The way to do it is to perform a join method before the main thread asking for result

    ```java
    for (Thread th : threads) {
        th.join();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < inputNumbers.size(); i++) {
        // Code for main thread to ask for results
    }
    ```

1. The join method ensures all the threads are executed. Once we run it we see result is now available.

    ```
    Factorial of 0 is 1
    Factorial of 3435 is 1878776..
    Factorial of 35435 is 386...
    Factorial of 2324 is 8214...
    Factorial of 4656 is 2669...
    Factorial of 23 is 25852...
    Factorial of 5556 is 1699515...
    ```

1. Cool ! What if one of our numbers is very large ex : `100000000L`. `List<Long> inputNumbers = Arrays.asList(100000000L, 3435L, 35435L, 2324L, 4656L, 23L, 5556L);`
1. In this case if we run the application it keeps on crunching numbers..with no output in sight.
1. The funny thing is other threads are actually completed but the main thead is still stuck on the `100000000L` one.
1. We can fix this by providing a time limit with join method invocation. Say after 2 sec if the thread hasn't terminated. The join method would return. - `th.join(2000);`

    ```
    Calculation of 100000000 is still in progress
    Factorial of 3435 is 1878776..
    Factorial of 35435 is 386...
    Factorial of 2324 is 8214...
    Factorial of 4656 is 2669...
    Factorial of 23 is 25852...
    Factorial of 5556 is 1699515...
    ```
1. However, main thread is still running ! For the main thread to use we can use daemon.
