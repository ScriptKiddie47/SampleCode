# BST ( Binary Search Tree )
1. Height Difference should not exceed one.
2. Left Hand side of tree will be smaller than root node
3. Right Hand side of the tree will be greater than root node
4. When we insert a element , we have to start from TOP
5. During insertion it will only compare 1 node per level.

## Implementation 
1. Class Structure - Height is not mandatory here
```java
class Node {
	int value;
	int height;
	Node left;
	Node right;
}
```
