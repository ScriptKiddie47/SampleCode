## Why Binary Tree ?
1. Max operations - T.C = O(log N)
2. Ordered Storage
3. Cost Efficient
4. Ex : File System, DB , Network Routing , Mathematical operations , ML
5. Image Compression ( Huffman coding )

### Properties
1. A node can point to 0,1,2 nodes.
2. Tree Size : Total Number of Nodes ( Circle )
3. Child-Parent
4. Siblings : Two child nodes having the same parent
5. Edge : 2 nodes being connected by a line
6. Height : Maximum number of edges between 2 nodes ( From a particular node to the leaf node - the max edges is height )
7. Leaf Nodes : Bottom Nodes
8. Level : Height of root - Height of node. = LEVEL
9. Root node level is always 0.
10. Ancestor-Descendant

### Limitation 
1. We can have a Unbalanced Binary Tree which will effect operation speed. For example : every node having just 1 child node in a single direction - O(n) T.C
2. Inefficient with Sorted Data

#### So how can be fix the limitation ?
1. Self Balancing Binary Tree

## Types of Binary Tree
1. Complete Binary Tree : All levels are full apart from last level ( leaf nodes ). Last full from left to right
2. Full/Strict BT : Each node has either 0 children or 2. Use case - Compression
3. Perfect Binary Tree : All the internal notes have 2 children and all the leaf nodes are on the same level.
4. Height Balanced BT : Height of the BT is O(log N) 
5. Skewed BT : Every node has only 1 child
6. Ordered BT : Every node has some property - ex BST

### Properties Revisioned
1. In a Perfect BT , total nodes = 2 <sup>(n+1)</sup> - 1

### Balanced Binary Tree
Different is height between 2 nodes should be +1,-1,0.

## BST ( Binary Search Tree )
1. Left Hand side of tree will be smaller than root node
2. Right Hand side of the tree will be greater than root node
