# Binary Tree

1. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children

## Full Binary Tree
1. A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

1. Some points
    - The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
    - 

1. Full Binary Tree Theorems , let
    - i = the number of internal nodes
    - n = be the total number of nodes
    - l = number of leaves
    - λ = number of levels

1. Then : 
    - The number of leaves is i + 1.
    - The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
    - The number of internal nodes is (n – 1) / 2.
    - The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
    - The total number of nodes is 2l – 1.
    - The number of internal nodes is l – 1.
    - The number of leaves is at most 2λ - 1.
