1. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children

## Full Binary Tree
1. A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

1. Some points
    - The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
    - 

1. Full Binary Tree Theorems , let
    - i = the number of internal nodes
    - n = be the total number of nodes
    - l = number of leaves
    - λ = number of levels

1. Then : 
    - The number of leaves is i + 1.
    - The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
    - The number of internal nodes is (n – 1) / 2.
    - The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
    - The total number of nodes is 2l – 1.
    - The number of internal nodes is l – 1.
    - The number of leaves is at most 2λ - 1.

1. Java Code to check if a tree is a full binary tree

```java
public class Main {
    Node root;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.root = new Node(1);
        main.root.leftChild = new Node(2);
        main.root.rightChild = new Node(3);
        main.root.leftChild.leftChild = new Node(4);
        main.root.leftChild.rightChild = new Node(5);
        main.root.rightChild.leftChild = new Node(6);
        main.root.rightChild.rightChild = new Node(7);
        System.out.println("Binary Tree : " + main.isFullBinaryTree(main.root));
    }
    boolean isFullBinaryTree(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return true;
        if (node.leftChild == null & node.rightChild == null) return true;
        if (node.leftChild != null & node.rightChild != null) {
            return isFullBinaryTree(node.leftChild) && isFullBinaryTree(node.rightChild);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
class Node {
    int data;
    Node leftChild, rightChild;
    Node(int item) {
        data = item;
    }
}
```

# Perfect Binary Tree

1. A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
1. All the internal nodes have a degree of 2.
