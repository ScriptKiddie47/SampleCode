# Complete Binary Tree
1. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
1. A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
1. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
