# SQL 

### Note : The Commands here are based on the DB defined in Postgres docker file based on dvdrental DB

## SELECT
```sql
select customer_id,last_name ,email  from customer;
```

## DISTINCT ( Unique )
```sql
select distinct rental_rate from film
select distinct (rating) from film
```
## COUNT
```sql
select count(rating) from film
select count(distinct (rating)) from film  
```
## WHERE

1. When comparing string the case matters

```sql
select * from customer where first_name = 'Jared'
select * from film where rental_rate > 4
select * from film where rental_rate > 4 and replacement_cost >= 19.99
select * from film where rental_rate > 4 and replacement_cost >= 19.99 and rating = 'R'
select film_id,rating from film where rating = 'R' or rating = 'PG-13'
select * from film where rating != 'R'
```

## OREDER BY
1. Numberic,Date or Alphabetical
2. Default is Ascending
```sql
select * from customer order by first_name;
select * from customer order by first_name ASC;
select store_id,first_name,last_name from customer order by store_id DESC,first_name ASC;
select * from payment order by payment_date DESC;
```

## LIMIT
```sql 
select * from payment order by payment_date desc limit 5
```
## BETWEEN

1. Can be usec with Dates as well.
2. Dates should be ISO 8601 standard format.3
3. When dealing with Date becareful

```sql
select * from payment where amount between 8 and 9
select * from payment where amount not between 8 and 9
select * from payment where payment_date between '2007-02-01' and '2007-02-15' 
```

## IN
```
select * from payment where amount in ( 0.99,1.98,1.99)
select * from payment where amount not in ( 0.99,1.98,1.99)
select * from customer where first_name in ( 'John','Jake','Julie')
```

## LIKE
1. Perform Pattern Matching against String values with the usage of wildcard
2. `ILIKE` is case in sensitive 
```sql
select * from customer where first_name like 'J%' --Everyone whos first name starts with the letter J

select * from customer where first_name like 'J%' and last_name like 'S%' -- first name starts with the letter J and last name starts with capital S 

select * from customer where first_name ilike 'j%' and last_name ilike 's%' -- Disable Case Sensitivity.

select * from customer where first_name like '%er%' --Anyone who has 'er' somewhere in their first name. er at the start/end is valid as well. eg : Heather

select * from customer where first_name like '_her%' -- Only one character is allowed before 'er' keyword. eg : Catherine,Theresa..!

select * from customer where first_name not like '_her%'
select * from customer where first_name like 'A%' and last_name not like 'B%' order by last_name --first name starts with caps 'A' & last name doesn't start with caps 'B'

select customer_id,first_name,address_id from customer
where address_id < 500 and first_name like 'E%'
order by customer_id desc
limit 1 -- What customer has the highest customer ID number whose name starts with an 'E' and has an address ID lower than 500?
```

## Aggregate Functions
1. URL : https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html
2. Only works with Select & Having clause
3. Special Note :
AVG() returns a floating point value. Use Round() to specify precision
```sql
select min(replacement_cost) from film;
select max(replacement_cost) from film;
select min(replacement_cost),max(replacement_cost) from film;
select avg(replacement_cost) from film; -- Output: 19.9840000000000000
select round(avg(replacement_cost),2) from film; -- Rounded to 2 decimal places , output : 19.98
select sum(replacement_cost) from film;
```

## GROUP BY 
### Allows us to aggregate columns per some category
1. Choose a `categorical column`
2. Split the table based on a category
3. Then use a aggregate function to join the data
4. `GROUP BY` clause must appear right after a FROM or WHERE statement.
5. In the select statement , columns must either have an aggregate function or be in a group by call
6. Where statement should not refer to the aggregation result. We can use `having` for that later.
7. If you want to sort results based on aggregate, make sure to reference the entire function
```sql
select customer_id from payment
group by customer_id
order by customer_id -- This is essentially the same as distinct

select customer_id,sum(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
order by customer_id -- Total sum every customer spent

select customer_id,sum(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
order by sum(amount) -- Same as above , modified the order

select customer_id,COUNT(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
order by count(amount) desc -- count how many transaction a customer is having

select staff_id,customer_id,sum(amount) from payment
group by staff_id,customer_id  /*Total amount spent per staff per customer

staff_id|customer_id|sum   |
--------+-----------+------+
       2|          1| 53.85|
       1|          1| 60.85|
So it looks like customer 1 spent $60.85 with staff 1. Then $53.85 with staff 2
*/

select DATE(payment_date),sum(amount) from payment
group by DATE(payment_date)
order by sum(amount) -- total $$ processed each day

select staff_id,count(payment_id) from payment
group by staff_id -- how many payments did each staff memeber handle

select rating,round(avg(replacement_cost),2) from film
group by rating
order by round(avg(replacement_cost),2) -- average replacement cost per MPAA rating

select customer_id,sum(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
order by sum(amount) desc
limit 5 -- Customer ID's of the top  5 customer by Total Spend
```
## HAVING 
1. Allows us to filter an aggregation has already taken place
```sql
select customer_id,sum(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
having sum(amount) > 100 -- Only consider the amout total which exceeds 100

select store_id,count(*) from customer
group by store_id
having count(*) > 300

select store_id,count(customer_id) from customer
group by store_id
having count(customer_id) > 300

select customer_id,count(amount) from payment
group by customer_id
having count(amount) >= 40
order by count(amount) desc -- Customers that had 40 or more transaction payments.

select customer_id,staff_id,sum(amount) from payment
where staff_id = 2
group by customer_id,staff_id
having sum(amount) > 110
order by customer_id --  Return the customer IDs of customers who have spent at least $110 with the staff member who has an ID of 2.
```

## Alias
```sql
select amount as rental_price from payment -- Output will come as rental_price
select sum(amount) as net_revenue from payment 
select count(*) as num_transactions from payment

select customer_id,sum(amount) as total_spent
from payment
group by customer_id
having sum(amount) > 100 -- This is correct 

select customer_id,sum(amount) as total_spent
from payment
group by customer_id
having total_spent > 100 -- This is in-correct
```

#### Note : `as` operator executes at the very end of the query , so we cannot execute it at the very end.

## Joins

Reference : https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/

1. Allows us to compare multiple tables together

### Inner Join 

1. Will result with the set of records that `match in both tables`.
2. It is `symmetrical`.

```sql
select * from payment
inner join customer
on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id 
/* this is same as  customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id  
due to symmetrical proerty of inner join*/

select payment_id,payment.customer_id,first_name from payment-- We specifically mention payment.customer_id to avoid ambiguity
inner join customer
on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id

-- What are the email of the customers who live in california
select customer.address_id,email,district from customer
inner join address
on customer.address_id = address.address_id
where district like 'Cali%'

-- JOIN 3 Tables
-- List of movies 'Nick Wahlberg' has been in
select
	actor.actor_id,
	actor.first_name,
	actor.last_name,
	film_actor.film_id,
	film.title
from
	actor
inner join film_actor on
	actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
inner join film on 
	film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
where 
	first_name = 'Nick'
	and last_name = 'Wahlberg'
```
### Full Outer Join

1. Grab Everything
2. Using `WHERE` we can get rows unique to either tables. This is exact opposite to `Inner Joins`

```sql
select * from customer
full outer join payment
on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id

select * from customer
full outer join payment
on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
where customer.customer_id is null or payment.payment_id is null
```


### Left Outer Join [ Order Matters ]

1. Results in the set of records that are in the left table.
If no match with the right table , the results are null
2. `WHERE` statement , amplifies this. So we can find rows unique to a single table

```sql
select film.film_id,title,inventory_id,store_id from film
left join inventory on
inventory.film_id = film.film_id 

select film.film_id,title,inventory_id,store_id from film
left join inventory on
inventory.film_id = film.film_id
where inventory.film_id is null 
-- Ouptut
film_id|title                 |inventory_id|store_id|
-------+----------------------+------------+--------+
     14|Alice Fantasia        |            |        |
     33|Apollo Teen           |            |        |
```

### Right Outer Join

1. Exact same thing as LEFT OUTER JOIN , we just switched the tables around
2. `WHERE` statement also enhances it

## UNION

1. Combine 2 or more select statements result-set

## Date & Time

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html

1. TIME
2. DATE
3. TIMESTAMP
4. TIMESTAMPTZ - TZ is for timezone

```sql
-- Suppose payment_date is '2007-02-15 22:25:46.996'
select DATE(payment_date) from payment -- Filter out date from timestamp. Output - 2007-02-15

-- Show Current Timezone 
show timezone -- Asia/Kolkata

-- Give me current timestamp ( Standard GMT )
select now() -- 2024-01-02 16:33:28.610 +0530|

-- TimeofDay ( we get a string back )
select timeofday() -- Tue Jan 02 16:35:44.754374 2024 IST

select current_time -- 16:36:31 +0530
select current_date --   2024-01-02
```
### Lets do some extraction from table

```sql
-- Suppose you have data in the below format
/*
payment_id|customer_id|staff_id|rental_id|amount|payment_date           |
----------+-----------+--------+---------+------+-----------------------+
     17503|        341|       2|     1520|  7.99|2007-02-15 22:25:46.996|
*/

select extract(year from payment_date) from payment limit 1 -- 2007
select extract(month from payment_date) from payment limit 1 -- 2
select extract(day from payment_date) from payment limit 1 -- 15

-- How old a timestamp is in regard to our current date
select age(payment_date) from payment limit 1 -- 16 years 10 mons 14 days 01:34:13.003423

-- to_char is a generilized function from converting one data type to another data type
select to_char(payment_date,'MONTH-YYYY') from payment limit 1 -- FEBRUARY -2007 ( The - here is something we added)

select to_char(payment_date,'mon/dd/yyyy') from payment limit 1 -- feb/15/2007

select to_char(payment_date,'MM/dd/yyyy') from payment limit 1 -- 02/15/2007

select to_char(payment_date,'dd-MM-yyyy') from payment limit 1 -- 15-02-2007

select distinct(to_char(payment_date,'MONTH')) from payment -- Get Distinct month names

select count(trim(to_char(payment_date,'DAY'))) from payment
where trim(to_char(payment_date,'DAY')) = 'MONDAY' -- sol#1 how many payment occurred on Monday

select count(*) from payment
where extract(dow from payment_date) = 1 -- sol#2 how many payment occurred on Monday
```

## MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html

```sql
select rental_rate/replacement_cost from film

select round(rental_rate/replacement_cost,2) from film

select round(rental_rate/replacement_cost,2)*100 from film -- in terms of %

select round(rental_rate/replacement_cost,2)*100 as percent_cost from film

select 0.1 * replacement_cost as deposit from film
```

## String Functions

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/functions-string.html

```sql
select length(first_name) from customer -- Get length

-- Concatinate first and last name
select first_name || last_name from customer -- JaredEly ( missing space )
select first_name || ' ' ||last_name from customer -- Jared Ely
select first_name || ' ' ||last_name as full_name from customer -- Jared Ely

-- Concatinate first letter of first name and last name
select first_name ||last_name || '@gmail.com' as emailID from customer -- JaredEly@gmail.com
select left(first_name,1) ||last_name || '@gmail.com' as emailID from customer -- JEly@gmail.com
select lower(left(first_name,1)) || lower(last_name) || '@gmail.com' as emailID from customer -- jely@gmail.com
```

## SUB - QUERY & EXITS

1. Perfrom query on the results of another query
2. Subquery is run first
3. We can also use the `IN` operator in conjunction with the subquery
4. Subquery can operate on a separate table
5. EXISTS operator is used to test for existance of rows in a subquery

```sql
select title,rental_rate from film 
where  rental_rate > (select round(avg(rental_rate),2) from film) -- subquery gets executed first

select film_id,title from film where
film_id in 
(select inventory.film_id from rental
inner join inventory on inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
where return_date between '2005-05-29' and '2005-05-30')
order by film_id

-- TABLE ALIAS USED HERE
-- Customers who amout is greater than $11
select first_name,last_name from customer as c
where exists(select * from payment as p where p.customer_id = c.customer_id and amount > 11)

-- Opposite of Above
select first_name,last_name from customer as c
where not exists(select * from payment as p where p.customer_id = c.customer_id and amount > 11)
```

## SELF JOIN
1. Query in which a table is join to itself.
2. Self-joins are usefull for comparing values in a column of rows within the same table.
3. Can also be viewed as a join of two copies of the same table.
4. The table is not actually copied , but SQL performs the command as though it were.
5. There is no special keyword for self join, its simply standard JOIN syntax with the same table in both parts.
6. Keep a note of the 'table alias'

```sql
-- Comparing movie lengths
select f1.title,f2.title,f1.length
from film as f1
inner join film as f2 on 
f1.film_id != f2.film_id and f1.length = f2.length

title               |title                 |length|
--------------------+----------------------+------+
Chamber Italian     |Resurrection Silverado|   117|
Chamber Italian     |Magic Mallrats        |   117|
.
.

```

7. This is little difficult to grasp.
