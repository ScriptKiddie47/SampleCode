# Docker External Storage

1. Manage Data in Images and Containers
1. Temporary Data - Objects , Temp files. 
    - Stored in Container - We can generally discard them
    - Images are Ready Only. Container can do both read/write
    - Once we remove the container the temp data is discarded
1. Permant App Data
    - Stored in Files
    - Must not be lost if container stops/restarts.
    - So how do we do it ? - Volumes.

1. We have a simple ( node + express ) application , which records feedback , creates a file and stores it in a folder called `temp`. Then a code checks if a file exists in temp folder. It copies it to a `feedback` folder.

1. Lets create a simple docker file.

```docker
FROM node:20-alpine3.17
WORKDIR /app # Create & set a working dir
COPY package.json . #Copy package.json to wroking directory
RUN npm install # Install Dependencies
COPY . . # Copy remaining code
ENV PORT 80
EXPOSE $PORT # Fancy way , we can do direct EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node","server.js"]
```

1. Lets build the image with a tag name : `$ docker build -t feedback-node .` ( note the dot(.) )
1. Lets start a container based on the image : `$ docker run -p 3000:80 -d --name feedback-app-1 --rm feedback-node`
1. Once we submit a feedback , we can see it reflected in the `feedback` folder as a txt file.
1. Generally if we don't delete the container the data still remains.
1. Also multiple containers based on the same image are isolated from each other. So that means they don't share the same mem space.


## Volume 

1. Volumes are folders on your host machines hard drive which are mounted ( made available,mapped ) into containers.
    - This is different from `COPY . .` command in Dockerfile.
    - Container can interact with Volume to read/write data.
1. They continue to persist even if container is removed.
1. Lets do a very quick volume implmentation

```docker
......
ENV PORT 80
EXPOSE $PORT
VOLUME [ "app/feedback" ] # Path inside of our container which will be mapped outside of the container to a volume.
CMD ["node","server.js"]
```

1. Note : Cross device error can happen with source code when working with volumes , code responsefully !!
1. Currently lets docker take control of the volumen locaiton etc .. ( Note : We haven't created a volume at this point)
1. Rebuild Image - `$ docker build -t feedback-node:volume .`
1. Create container - `$ docker run -p 3000:80 -d --name feedback-app-volume --rm feedback-node:volume`
1. So what happens here is once we save the feedback the data gets written to the volume. But if we stop and create a new container. The data in volume as disappears. Why ?
    - Anonymous volumes which we are using above.
        - Stops alongside the containe. Stopping container stops anonymous volume.
        - Now you just start piling up a bunch of unused anonymous volumes - you can clear them via docker volume `rm VOL_NAME` or `docker volume prune`.
    - Named volumes
        - Can't be created inside of a docker file
        - Created when we run a container

1. Access docker volumes ? 

```bash
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     e07cdcda7d7ee1efb6671b812d788b7f8244411251fc2d6cd8675d2f8bbe8059
```
 
1. We see the anonymous volume we createed above.
1. Lets create a named volume. Delete `VOLUME [ "app/feedback" ]` as its not required for a named volume.
1. Rebuild image : `docker build -t feedback-node:volume .`
1. Named Image container create command : `$ docker run -p 3000:80 -d --name feedback-app-volume --rm  -v feedback-volume:/app/feedback feedback-node:volume`
    - `v feedback-volume:/app/feedback`
    - Store `/app/feedback` in a managed volume under a name chosen by us
    - feedback volume won't be deleted once we close the container
1. Do some operation. Stop Container. Check volume


```
$ docker stop feedback-app-2
feedback-app-2
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     feedback-volume
```

1. Volume Still exits nice.
1. Create a new container with same volume name. We see the old data still exits. 
1. Volume details can be obtained using 

```bash
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     728b30a97d7730715fbd54427a015ca63913678155db8a0b2850382c3a9bf4d3
local     c2e3d39513cfa77b450d212cb55350dd89e2fdc1515a6ae94855585f5d5e3933
local     feedback-volume
Syn: ~/Documents/CodeSource/Github/SampleCode/docker/docker-node-js (master)
$ docker volume inspect feedback-volume 
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-03-15T08:29:46Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/feedback-volume/_data", // This is not the actual path
        "Name": "feedback-volume",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

## Bind Mounts

1. This is a Developer focused feature. Docker doesn't manage this  so it won't show up on `docker volums ls`
1. So currently if we change a sourcecode ,we would need to rebuild & restart a container.
1. This isn't ideal. so lets control it
1. Bindmounts are used for these purpose itself. We can define a path on our host machine 
1. So we can put our source code in a bind mounts so the container will be aware of it.
1. So source code is not used from `COPY . .` , instead used from a bind mount.
1. Lets do it - 

```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm \
--name feedback-app-2 \
-v feedback-volume:/app/feedback \
-v /home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/Github/SampleCode/docker/docker-node-js:/app \
-v /app/node_modules \
feedback-node:volume
```

1. `-v /home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/Github/SampleCode/docker/docker-node-js:/app`
    - We provide the absolute path. We also must confirm file sharing is turned on and pointed to the right directory

1. `-v /app/node_modules`
    - Anonymous volume to handle the node modules


![image](images/docker1.png)

1. Node JS extra : Nodemon
1. In package.json add

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  },
/.....
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon":"3.1.0"
  }
}
```

1. Dockerfile - `CMD ["node","server.js"]` to CMD ["npm","start"]
1. Rebuild and re deploy

## Read only Volumes

1. We can make the  volumes read only with suffix :ro

```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm \
--name feedback-app-2 \
-v feedback-volume:/app/feedback \
-v /home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/Github/SampleCode/docker/docker-node-js:/app:ro \
-v /app/temp \
-v /app/node_modules \
feedback-node:volume
```
1. Didn't understand SHIT


## MongoDB Volume

1. Best look at documentation

```bash
docker run -d --rm \
--network goals-net \
-v data:/data/db \
--name mongodb \
mongo
```

1. Mongo DB Auth

```bash
docker run -d --rm \
--network goals-net \
-v data:/data/db \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
--name mongodb \
mongo
```

1. Standard Auth : `mongodb://mongoadmin:secret@mongodb:27017/DBNAME?authSource=admin`
