Factory Method Pattern:
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that
 just define an interface or abstract class for creating an 
 object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
 
 In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
 
 Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. 
That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, 
so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.

Step 1: Create a Plan abstract class
Step 2: Create the concrete classes that extends Plan abstract class.
Step 3: Create a GetPlanFactory to generate object of concrete classes based on given information.
Step 4: Generate Bill by using the GetPlanFactory to get the object of concrete classes by passing
 an information s as type of plan DOMESTICPLAN or COMMERCIALPLAN or INSTITUTIONALPLAN.
