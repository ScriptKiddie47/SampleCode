To sort an Object by its property, you have to make the Object implement the Comparable interface and override the compareTo() method. Lets see the new Fruit class again.

he new Fruit class implemented the Comparable interface, and overrided the compareTo() method to compare its quantity property in ascending order.

The compareTo() method is hard to explain, in integer sorting, just remember
this.quantity – compareQuantity is ascending order.
compareQuantity – this.quantity is descending order.
To understand more about compareTo() method, read this Comparable documentation.
