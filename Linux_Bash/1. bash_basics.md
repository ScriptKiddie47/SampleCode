# Shell Basics

### Which Shell are you running ?

```shell
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~ 
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
  57657 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
  59505 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```

### Create a shell script file and run it

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Today is " `date`

echo -e "\nenter the path to directory"
read the_path

echo -e "\n you path has the following files and folders: "
ls $the_path
```

Running it in Shell - `sh run_all.sh ` or `bash run_all.sh` or `./run_all.sh`

```bash
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~/Desktop/Local 
$ sh run_all.sh 
Today is  Monday 29 January 2024 11:59:38 AM IST
-e 
enter the path to directory
/home/sbala/Desktop/Local
-e 
 you path has the following files and folders: 
ClientMain.java  ClientMain.java~  Creator.java  Hero.java  Hero.java~	Pr.java~  run_all.sh
```

`#!/bin/bash` - Shebang - Bash scripts start with a shebang. Shebang is a combination of bash # and bang ! followed by the bash shell path. This is the first line of the script. Shebang tells the shell to execute it via bash shell

### Variable Declaration

```bash
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~ 
$ country=india
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~ 
$ same_country=$country
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~ 
$ echo $country
india
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~ 
$ echo $same_country
india
```

### Reading User Input

1. We can read the user input using the read command - `read the_path` [ Show above ]
2. Reading from a file.

Lets create a file called `input.txt`
```
Hello,There
My fellow folks
```
Shell Code

```bash
# File - run_all.sh
while read line
do
  echo $line
done < input.txt
```

Output:

```
$ sh run_all.sh 
Hello,There
My fellow folks
sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~/Desktop/Local
```
3. Command line arugment

```bash
File - run_all.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello,$1!"

sbala@sbala-Nitro-AN515-52 ~/Desktop/Local 
$ sh run_all.sh Syndicate
Hello,Syndicate!
```

### Terminal Outputs

1. Use `echo` command.
2. Writing to a file - `echo "This is some text." > output.txt`
3. Appending to a file - `echo "More text." >> output.txt`
4. Redirecting output - `ls > files.txt`

### Grep - File Search

1. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix
1. Grep, short for “global regular expression print”, is a command used for searching and matching text patterns in files contained in the regular expressions
1. Return all occurences of 'Linux' in text file - `$ grep "Linux" input.txt`
```bash
$ grep "Linux" input.txt 
Welcome to Linux !
Linux is a free and opensource Operating system that is mostly used by
and database servers. Linux has also made a name for itself in PCs.
Beginners looking to experiment with Linux can get started with friendlier linux
```
1.  Return all occurences of 'Linux' Ignoring space sensitivity - `$ grep -i "linux" input.txt`
1.  Count number of `lines` all occurences of 'Linux' Ignoring space sensitivity - `$ grep -c -i "linux" input.txt` 
1. Return all occurences of 'Linux' with line number - `$ grep -n "Linux" input.txt`
1. Return extact match of the word - `$ grep -w "opensource" input.txt`
1. Return all occurences in a Directory - `$ grep -r "main(" ./`- .
    - `,/` is current directory , we can replace here with the required directory.
    - `-r` here stands for recursive
1. A tool called `ack` does it super-fast. https://beyondgrep.com/ - Something to exlore later.
1. Grep with Regular expression
   - ^      Matches characters at the beginning of a line
   - $      Matches characters at the end of a line
   - "."    Matches any character
   - [a-z]  Matches any characters between A and Z
   - [^ ..] Matches anything apart from what is contained in the brackets.

1. Sample 
    - `$ grep -n ^d input.txt` - Lines starting with d
