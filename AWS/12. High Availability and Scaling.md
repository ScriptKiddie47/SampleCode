# 3 W's of Scaling

    1. What do we scale ?
    1. Where do we scale ?
    1. When do we scale ?

# EC2 Launch 

    1. Auto Scaling is only for EC2 ✅
    1. 

### Launch Templates ( New & Recommended )

    1. Specifies all the required setting that go into building out an EC2 instance.
    2. Don't have to walk through EC2 creation wizard
    3. Supports all EC2 Scaling features
    4. Suppports versioning
    5. More Granularity.
    6. Includes AMI,EC2 Instance Size,SG,Network Info ✅

### Launch Configurations ( Old )

    1. Only for EC2 Auto Scaling Feature
    2. Immutable
    3. Limited Configuration options


# EC2 Auto Scaling Groups

    1. Contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a collective group for purpose of scaling and management.

### Auto Scaling Steps

    1. Define Template
    2. Specify Network and Purschasing option if no already set in Template
        - Use Multiple AZ's for High Availability ✅
    3. LB Configuration - EC2 can be registered behind a load balancer
    4. Set Scaling Policy
    5. Notification - Through SNS

### Auto Scaling Restrictions

    1. Minumum EC2 Instances
    2. Maximum EC2 Instances
    3. Desired EC2 Instances at a given time.

### LifeCycle Hook

    1. Perform custom actions whenever corresponding lifecycle event occurs
    2. Capability to wait for 2 hours - WAIT STATE - Use the time to install software etc etc..

### Step Scaling

    1. Stepped Adjustmnets to vary the scaling depending on the size of the alarm breach.
    2. Scaling Out : Add
    3. Scaling In : Terminate

### Instance Warm-up & CoolDown 

    1. Warm-up : Stops instances form being terminated prematurely.
    2. Cooldown : Pauses Auto Scaling for a set amount of time - Avoid runaway scaling events.
    3. Avoid Thrashing : Create instance quickly and spin them down slowly.

### Scaling Types

    1. Reactive : Based on events
    2. Scheduled : Predictable Workload


# Scaling Relational DB

    1. Vertical Scaling $$
    2. Scaling Storage - Can only go up
    3. Read Replicas
    4. Aurora Serverless : Aurora Everything
    5. Multi-AZ : Standy Instance cannot be directly used

### Scaling vs Refactoring

    1. Refactoring and changing to DynamoDB is a viable scaling choice as per AWS

### Scaling Option - Dynamo DB

    1. Provisioned - Generally Predictable Workloads , most cost effective model ✅
    2. On Demand - Sporadic Workload ✅ 
    3. We can switch between provisioned & ondemand 2 times in a 24hr period ✅
    
### Read Capacity Unit  ( RCU )

    1. Dynamo DB unit of measurement for reads per second for an item up to 4KB in size.
    2. One strongly consistent readds per second
    3. 1 RCU = 4KB/1 Strongly Consistent Read ✅

### Write Capacity Unit ( WCU )
    
    1. Dynamo DB unit of measurement for writes per second for an item up to 1KB in size.
    2. 1 WCU = 1KB * 1 write per second ✅

# Disaster Recovery Strategy

    1. Recovery Point Objective ( RPO ) -  What point in time do we want our env recovered to ?
    2. Recovery Time Objective ( RTO ) -  How Quickly do you need to recover your environment ?
    3. Backup and Restore : Simplest DRS strategy , Cheap , Slowest
    4. Pilot Light : Faster than Backup and Restore but some downtime.
    5. Warm Standby : Scaled-down version of our production system already running in another AZ. More expensive than Pilot
    6. Active/Active Failover : Most expensive but no downtime and lowest RTO & RPO
