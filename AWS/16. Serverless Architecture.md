# Serverless Architecture

### AWS Lambda Functions

    1. Max time 15 mins (900s)  ✅
    2. Permission : IAM role for API GW etc..  ✅
    3. Max 1000 concurrent executions
    4. 4KB for all environment variables
    5. 128MB to 10 GB memory allocations  ✅
    6. Can be run inside or outside VPC ( Default ). VPC is required if we are trying to access a RDS resource

### Serverless Application Repository

    1. Define whole app via SAM Templates
    1. Publish & Deploy
    3. Heavy Integration with AWS Lambda

### Containers : EKS & ECS 

    1. Great for long running
    2. ECS : Elastic Container Service 
        - Easy to Setup & Scale
        - Propietary from AWS ✅
        - ECS Launch Type:
            - EC2
            - Fargate
    3. EKS : Elastic K8 Service
        - Based on K8 open source

### Removing Servers with Fargate ( Deployment type for ECS & EKS ✅ )

    1. Fargate Cannot work alone  ✅✅✅✅✅
    1. Fargate : Serverless computing engine for docker containers.
    2. Fargate vs Lambda :
        - Fargate : Consistent worloads.
        - Lambda : Unpredictable or Unconsistent workloads.
    3. User Friendly but $$$
    4. We leverage ECS Task roles for assinging IAM Permissions

### Amazon EventBridge ( Previously AWS CloudWatch Events )

    1. Serverless event bus. ✅
    2. Rule Triggers
        - Event Pattern
        - Scheduled : Rate Based or Cron
    3. Trigger action based on something happening in AWS ✅

### ECR ( Elastic Container Registry )

    1. AWS managed container image registry ✅
    2. Docker,OCI images and OCI artifacts ✅
    3. ECR Public is similar but open to public ✅
    4. LifeCycle Rules are available for maintenance ✅
    5. Image Scanning for Security 

### EKS Distro

    1. EKS-D : Fully managed by 'US'. Self Managed . Unlike EKS

### EKS Anywhere & ECS Anywhere

    1. On-Premise EKS & ECS
    2. On-Premise EKS : Based on EKS-D
    3. On-Premise EKS : ECS,SSM Agents are required

### Auto Scaling Amazon Aurora Serverless

    1. Aurora Serverless : On Demand with Auto Scaling & Budget Friendly ✅
    2. Aurora Capacity Units ( ACUs ) : Measurement of Clusters scale
    3. Use Case : Varibale workloads , dev/test , capacity planning , not sure of DB size ✅

### AWS X-Ray

    1. Application Insights ✅
    2. Works based on Traces. Tracing header X-Amzn-Trace-Id ✅✅
    3. Keywords : App request insights,view response times of downstream requests , HTTP response analysis


### AWS AppSync

    1. Scalable GraphQL Interface ✅
    2. Keywords : GraphQL, fetching app data , declarative coding and frontend app data fetching  ✅
