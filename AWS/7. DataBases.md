# RDS ( Relational DB Engines )

1. Provision DB's - Postgress , MYSQL , Oracle..
1. Multi-AZ
1. Failover capability
1. Usage - OLTP ( Online Transaction Processing )


## Multi-AZ RDS [ Disaster Recovery ]


1. ðŸ›‘ Multi-AZ RDS creates an exact copy our DB in another AZ. RDS will automatically failover so DB operations can resume quickly.
1. AWS Handles it for us.
1. Aurora  is by default multi-az
1. Multi AZ is for Disaster Recovery not about improving performance


## Read Replica [ Read Performance ]

1. Read only copy of our DB in same AZ,cross-AZ or cross Region
1. Each read replica has its own DNS endpoint

## Aurora [ AWS Tech ]

1. MYSQL - Postgres compatible DB
1. 5x better performance than MYSQL at much lower pricepoint
1. ðŸ›‘ 2 copies of our data are contained in each AZ with a minimum of 3 AZ. 6 copies of our data
1. Share Aurora spanshots with other accounts
1. 3 Types of replicaes -> Aurora , MySQL , PostgresSQL
1. Aurora Serverless -> on demand auto scaling [ Takes care of unpredictable worloads ]


# Dyanamo DB

1. No SQL. Stored in SSD
1. Eventually Consistent Reads ( Default )
1. Strongly Consistent Reads 

## DAX ( DynamoDB Accelerator )

1. In memory cache , 10x Cache

## Security

1. Encryption at rest using KMS
1. Compatible IAM policies and roles , Cloudwatch & CloudTrail
1. VPC Endpoints

## DynamoDB Transactions

1. ðŸ›‘ Enable it for ACID Transactions
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Case -> Financial Transactions , Fulfilling orders
1. 3 options for reads -> Eventually Consistent , Strongly Consistent Reads , Transactional
1. 2 Options for Write -> Standard & Transactional
1. Upto 25 items or 4 MB of data
 
 
### On Demand Backup And Restore

1. Zero Impact on performance, operates between same region as the source table

### PITR ( Point in Time Recovery )

1. Protects against accidents
1. ðŸ›‘ Restore to any point in last 35 days
1. Incremental Backups
1. Not enabled by default
1. Last Restorable : 5 mins in the past

## DynamoDB Streams

1. Time ordered sequence of item level changes in a table. FIFO streams of data.
1. Combine with AWS Lambda for functiality like stored procedures

## Global Tables

1. Read Replicas around the world baby
1. DynamoDB Steams must be turned on


## Amazon Document DB = MongoDB

1. Running MongoDB on AWS
1. Migrate MongoDB on AWS think Document DB

## Amazon KeySpaces = Cassandra

1. Think migrating Cassandra Cluster to AWS think Amazon Keyspaces

## Amazon Neptune = Graph DB

1. Think Graph DB think Neptune

## Amazon QLDB ( Quantum Ledger DB ) = Immutable DB

1. Immutable DB , no updates available
1. Use Case -> Financial trans , supply chain logs , claims history

## Amazon TimeStream = Time Series Data

1. Use Case -> IoT sensors , Analytics
