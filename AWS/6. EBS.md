# EBS Volumes

1. Storage volumes you can attach your EC2 instances into - Virtual Hard Disk
1. ðŸ›‘ Mission Critical Workloads,Highly available & Scalable.
1. ðŸ›‘ Location - EBS Volume will always be in the same az as EC2
1. Resizing - Resize on the Fly
1. Switch Volume types on the fly.

## IOPS vs Throughput

1. IOPS
    - ðŸ›‘ Measures the number of read and write ops per second.
    - Important metric for quick transactions , low latency apps , transactional workloads
    - ðŸ›‘ Choose Provisioned IOPS SSD ( io1 or io2 )
1. Throughput 
    - ðŸ›‘ Measures the number of bits read or written per second  ( MB/s ) 
    - Important metric for large datasets , large I/O sizes , complex queries
    - Ability to deal with large datasets
    - ðŸ›‘ Choose Throughput Optimized HDD ( st1 )

## EBS Types

### âœ… General Purpose SSD ( gp2 )

1. 3 IOPS per GiB, max 16,000 IOPS per volume
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: Good for boot volumes or development and test apps that not latency sensitive

### âœ… General Purpose SSD ( gp3 )

1. Predictable 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 MiB/s regardless of volume size
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: Ideal for apps that require high performance at low cost such as MySQL,Cassandra,Virtual Desktops,Hadoop Analytics
1. max 16,000 IOPS
1. 4x faster than gp2

### âœ… Provisioned IOPS SSD  ( io1 )

1. Old Gen
1. 64,000 IOPS
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: High Performance Apps - Large DB's, Latency Sensitive Workloads, OLTP

### âœ… Provisioned IOPS SSD  ( io2 )

1. New Gen
1. 64,000 IOPS
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: High Performance Apps - Large DB's, Latency Sensitive Workloads, OLTP
1. 99.999% Uptime

### âœ… Throughput Optimized HDD  ( st1 )

1. Low Cost HDD Volume
1. Baseline throughput 250 MB/s per TB
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: Frequently accessed , throughput-intensive workloads. Big Data , data warehoueses , ETC and log processing
1. Cost-effective way to store mountains of data
1. ðŸ›‘ Cannot be boot volumne

### âœ… Cold HDD  ( sc1 )

1. Cheap Cheap Cheap ->  apps that need lowest cost and performance is not a factor
1. Baseline throughput 12 MB/s per TB
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Cases: Data Requiring fewer scans per day.
1. ðŸ›‘ Cannot be boot volumne


# Snapshots

1. Exists on S3
1. Point in Time copy of a volume. Only capture data that has been written to your EBS Volume
1. Snapshots are incremental , means only the data that has been changed since your last snapshots are moved to S3.
1. Encrypted Snapshots - If EBS volume is encrypted , snaoshots will be encrypted as well.
1. We can also share snapshots

## EBS Encryptions

1. EBS encrypts our volume with a data key using the industry standard AES256 Algorithm
1. Uses KMS,CMK
1. Snapshots are encrypted. Volume created from snapshots are encrypted.
1. ðŸ›‘ Exam Topic -> 4 Steps to Encrypt an Unecnrypted volume
    - Create a snapshot of the uncrypted root device volume
    - Create a Copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
    - Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot
    - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances

## EC2 Hibernation

1. Preseve the RAM on EBS. RAM must be less than 150GB
1. Faster to Bootup.
1. Instances cannot be hibernated more than 60 days.

# EFS

1. Amazon Elastic File System
1. ðŸ›‘ Managed NFS ( Network File System ) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances. [ Linux Based ]
1. ðŸ›‘ Highly Available and Expensive
1. ðŸ›‘ Use Case -> Content Management , Web Server
1. File System scales automatically. Pay per use
1. Highly Scalabe Shared Storage using NFS , this EFS

# FSX 

1. FSX for Windows ( Build of Windows Server ) provides us a fully managed native microsoft windows file system. [ SMB - Windows Based File Service ]
1. Sharepoint or (AD) Active Directory - Windows shared storage - Think about FSX for Windows
1. FSX for Lustre - Compute Intensive Workload ( ML & AI ) - Think Massive Data Set 

## Tips

1. EFS : Need distributed , high resilient storage for linux instances and linux based apps
1. FSX for Windows - Microsoft apps - Sharepoint, SQL Server,IIS Web Server 
1. FSX for Lustre ( Linux ) - High Performance , can store data directly on S3


# AMI 

1. Amazon Machine Image
1. AMI backed by
    - EBS
    - Instance Store - The root device for an instance launced from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.

# Instance Store volumes

1. Instance Store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage.
1. Instance store volumes cannot be stopped ( EBS can ). If the underlying host fails , you will lose the data.
1. However we can reboot the instance without loosing our data.
1. If we delete the instance , we loose Instance Store volume

##  AWS Backup Benefits

1. Central Management 
1. Automation
1. Improved Compliance - Encryption , Auditing
