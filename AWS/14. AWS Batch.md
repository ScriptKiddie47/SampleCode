# AWS BATCH

    1. Batched Workloads
        - Allows us to run batch computing workloads within AWS ( EC2/ECS/Fargate )
    2. Automatically provision & scale
    3. No Install Required

### Components

    1. Jobs - Units of work submitted to AWS Batch ( Shell Scripts , executables , docker images )
    2. Job Definitions : Specify how jobs will be run
    3. Job Queues : Where Job gets submitted to
    4. Compute Environment : Set of managed or unmanaged compute resources used to run our jobs

#### EC2 VS Fargate 

    1. Fargate 
        - Recommended for most workloads
        - Fast Start times
    2. EC2
        - More control 
        - Require GPU,Custom AMI etc

#### AWS Batch vs AWS Lambda

    1.AWS Batch :
        - no time limit
        - leverage docker so any runtime can be used.
    2. AWS Lambda :
        - 15 mins max
        - Disk Space is costly
        - Limited Runtimes

#### AWS BATCH MANAGED VS UNMANAGED

    1. MANAGED
        - AWS manages capacity
        - VPC
        - Use our own AMI
        - Leverage Fargate, SPot etc..
    2. UNMANAGED
        - We manage capacity , everything
        - Must meed ECS AMI specs
        - Good for extremely complex or specific requirements
