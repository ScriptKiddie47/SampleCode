## Security Groups

1. Virtual Firewalls for EC2 Instances. All inbound traffic is blocked by Default. All Outbound traffic is allowed
1. In order to able to communicate to your ec2 instances via SSH/RDP/HTTP/HTTPS , you need to open up the correct ports
1. Lets create a new one.

Inbound rules (2)

| Security group rule ID | IP version |Type    | Prtocols |Port range |  Source    |
| --------               | -------    |------- | -------  |-------    |  -------   |
| sgr-07be979155e41d41d  | IPv4       |HTTP    | TCP      | 443       | 0.0.0.0/0  |
| sgr-0b96586483f35efce  | IPv4       |HTTPS   | TCP      | 80        | 0.0.0.0/0  |

Outbound rules (1) (2)

| Security group rule ID | IP version |Type    | Prtocols |Port range |  Destination    |
| --------               | -------    |------- | -------  |-------    |  -------   |
| sgr-02f26565ce1f77104  | IPv4       |All traffic    | All      | All       | 0.0.0.0/0  |


## BootStrap Scripts

1. A script that runs when the instance first runs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello Cloud Gurus</h1></body></html>" > index.html
```

1. Paste the above details when creating EC2 Server -> Advanced details
1. Use the above security group.
1. Once the EC2 Server starts , navigate to instance -> Networking -> Copy `Public IPv4 address` -> Paste in browser and voila we see the message `Hello Cloud Gurus`

## EC2 Metadata

1. Public IPv4 address,Private IPv4 addresses,hostname,security group etc..
1. Using curl command we can query metadata about our EC2 instance.

## EC2 Networking

1. WE can have 3 different types of virtual networrking cards to our EC2 Instances
1. ENI -> Elastic Network Interface -> Basic, day to day networking
    - Virtual network card that allows Private,Public IPv4 addresses.
    - Many IPv6 Addresses
    - MAC address
    - 1 or more security groups.
    - Uses -> Management Network, low budget.  
1. EN -> Enhanced Networking -> Uses single root I/O virtualization to provide high performance
    - 10 Gbps - 100 Gbps 
    - Comes in diff flavors 
        - 🛑 Elastic Network Adapter `ENA` -> Supports upto 100 Gbps
        - Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) Interface  -> Upto 10 Gbps ( Typically used on older instances)
1. EFA -> Elastic Fabric Adapter -> Accelerate High Performance Computing ( HPC ) and machine learning applications.
    - Lower & more consistent latency
    - 🛑 Can use OS-BYPASS ( Only on Linux )


## EC2 Placement groups

1. Cluster Placement Group -> Grouping of instance within single AZ. 
    - Recommended for apps that need low network latency,high network throughput or both. 
    - Only certain instance types can be launched into a cluster placement group.
1. Spread Placement Group -> Group of instances that are placed on distinct underlying hardware. 
    - Recommended for apps that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
1. Partition placement group -> Each partition placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. Isolate impact of hardware failure. 
    - HDFS,HBase,Cassandra
    - Cannot span multiple AZ unlike the above 2
1. 🛑 AWS Recommends homogenous instances within placement groups.
1. 🛑 We cannot merge placement groups
1. We can move existing instance into a placement group. Before we move it , the instance must be in a stopped state.

## VMware on EC2

1. 🛑 We can deploy vCenter on the AWS Cloud. Use case
    - Hybrid Cloud
    - Cloud Migration
    - Disaster Recovery VMware
    - Leverage AWS

## AWS Outpost

1. Brings AWS Data center directly to you , on-premise.
1. Benefits 
    - Hybrid Cloud
    - Fully Managed Infra
    - Consistency
1. 🛑 Outpost Family Members
    - 🛑 Outpost Rack
        - Hardware -> 42U rack and scale up to 96 racks
        - Results -> Gives same AWS infra
    - 🛑 Outpost Servers
    - Hardward -> Individual servers in 1U ir 2U
    - Use Case -> Small Space such as retail store , branch offices
    - Results -> Provide local computer and networking services

## Hands ON LAB 1

1. Setup group of 3 EC2 instances with Apache Web Server , AWS CLI & MYSQL DB.
1. We already have a EC2 Created for us with Username & Password available. Lets do the setup manually
1. SSH into EC2 from our Linux terminal ( NO AWS CLI HERE )

    ```sh
    Syn: ~ 
    $ ssh cloud_user@54.90.138.6

    ``` 

1. Phew doing the above manually was time consuming , lets do bootstrap.
1. Create a new EC2 machine paste the below bootstrap 

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install apache2 unzip -y
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    unzip awscliv2.zip
    sudo ./aws/install

## HANDS ON LAB 2 

### Scenario
You are responsible for ensuring your applications hosted in Amazon EC2 are able to securely access other AWS services. Credentials need to be rotated regularly to minimize the adverse impact of a security breach. You want to minimize the time it takes to manage these credentials. AWS IAM roles provide the ability to automatically grant instances temporary credentials without the need for manual management. IAM instance profiles provide the mechanism to attach IAM roles to EC2 instances.

1. Instance Profile - Entity/Container used for connecting IAM role to EC2 Instance
1. Instance Profile provide temp credential which are rotated automatically.
1. Instance Profile creation/update is handled behind the scenes when done through AWS Management Console.

### Steps

1. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provide the ability to grant instances temporary credentials. These temporary credentials can then be used by hosted applications to access permissions configured within the role. IAM roles eliminate the need for managing credentials, help mitigate long-term security risks, and simplify permissions management. Prerequisites for this lab include understanding how to log in to and use the AWS Management Console, EC2 basics (including how to launch an instance), IAM basics (including users, policies, and roles), and how to use the AWS CLI.

1. Note: When connecting to the bastion host and the web server, do so independently of each other. The bastion host is used for interacting with AWS services via the CLI.


#### Create a Trust Policy and Role Using the AWS CLI
1. Obtain the labreferences.txt File -> File contains S3 Bucket details
1. Navigate to S3.
1. From the list of buckets, open the one that contains the text s3bucketlookupfiles in the middle of its name.
1. Select the labreferences.txt file.
1. Click Actions > Download.
1. Open the labreferences.txt file, as we will need to reference it throughout the lab.

####  Log in to Bastion Host and Set the AWS CLI Region and Output Type

1. Navigate to EC2 > Instances.
1. Copy the public IP of the Bastion Host instance.
1. Open a terminal, and log in to the bastion host via SSH:
1. ssh cloud_user@<BASTION_HOST_PUBLIC_IP>
1. Enter the password provided for it on the lab page.
1. Run the following command:
1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws configure
    - Press Enter twice to leave the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key blank.
    - Enter us-east-1 as the default region name.
    - Enter json as the default output format.
1. Create IAM Trust Policy for an EC2 Role
1. Create a file called trust_policy_ec2.json:
1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ nano trust_policy_ec2.json
1. Paste in the following content:
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```

1. Save and quit the file by pressing ^X, Y to save, and hit return to accept the existing file name.
1. Create the DEV_ROLE IAM Role - Run the following AWS CLI command:
1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-role --role-name DEV_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy_ec2.json

1. Create an IAM Policy Defining Read-Only Access Permissions to an S3 Bucket
1. Create a file called dev_s3_read_access.json:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ nano dev_s3_read_access.json
1. Enter the following content, replacing <DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME> with the bucket name provided in the labreferences.txt file:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
            "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
            "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:Get*",
                    "s3:List*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
1. Save and quit the file by pressing ^X, Y to save, and hit return to accept the existing file name.
1. Create the managed policy called DevS3ReadAccess:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-policy --policy-name DevS3ReadAccess --policy-document file://dev_s3_read_access.json
1. Copy the policy ARN in the output, and paste it into the labreferences.txt file — we'll need it in a minute.
1. Create Instance Profile and Attach Role to an EC2 Instance
1. Attach Managed Policy to Role
1. Attach the managed policy to the role, replacing <DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN> with the ARN you just copied:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DEV_ROLE --policy-arn "<DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN>"
1. Verify the managed policy was attached:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name DEV_ROLE
1. Create the Instance Profile and Add the DEV_ROLE via the AWS CLI
1. Create instance profile named DEV_PROFILE:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
1. Add role to the DEV_PROFILE called DEV_ROLE:
1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE --role-name DEV_ROLE
1. Verify the configuration:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
1. Attach the DEV_PROFILE Role to an Instance
1. In the AWS console, navigate to EC2 > Instances.

1. Copy the instance ID of the instance named Web Server instance and paste it into the labreferences.txt file — we'll need it in a second.

1. In the terminal, attach the DEV_PROFILE to an EC2 instance, replacing <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> with the Web Server instance ID you just copied:

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> --iam-instance-profile Name="DEV_PROFILE"
Verify the configuration (be sure to replace <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> with the Web Server instance ID again):

1. [cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID>
1. This command's output should show this instance is using DEV_PROFILE as an IamInstanceProfile. Verify this by locating the IamInstanceProfile section in the output, and look below to make sure the "Arn" ends in /DEV_PROFILE.

1. Test S3 Permissions via the AWS CLI
1. In the AWS console, copy the public IP of the Web Server instance.

1. Open a new terminal.

1. Log in to the web server instance via SSH:
1. ssh cloud_user@<WEB_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
1. Use the same password for the bastion host provided on the lab page.

1. Verify the instance is assuming the DEV_ROLE role:

1. [cloud_user@webserver]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
1. We should see DEV_ROLE in the Arn.

1. List the buckets in the account:

1. [cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls
1. Copy the entire name (starting with cfst) of the bucket with s3bucketdev in its name.

1. Attempt to view the files in the s3bucketdev- bucket, replacing <s3bucketdev-123> with the bucket name you just copied:

1. [cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketdev-123>
1. We should see a list of files.
