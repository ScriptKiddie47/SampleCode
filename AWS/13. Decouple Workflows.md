# Decouple Workflows

    1. SQS
    2. SNS
    3. API Gateways

## SQS

    1. Poll Based -  FIFO
    2. Delivey Delay : Default is 0 , can be set up to 15 mins
    3. Message Size : 256KB
    4. Message Retention : Default is 4 days , can be set between 1 minute and 14 Days.
    5. Long vs Short Polling : Long polling isn't the default.
    6. Queue Depth : Can be a Trigger for AutoScaling.
    7. Encryption : Encrypted in transit by default, but we can add at-rest.
    8. Visibility Timeout : Lock on a message till its done processing. Prevent other apps to lock onto that same message

### DLQ 

    1. Targets for messages that connect be processed successfully.
    1. Works with SQS & SNS
    1. Redrive Capability allows us to move the messages back into source queue.
    1. Debugging
    1. Setup Cloudwatch Alarm to monitor queue depth

### SQS Message Ordering

    1. Standard Queue 
        - Order not garunteed , High Performance , $
        - Duplicate Message - If happening consistently , maybe developer forgot to delete messages
        - Unlimited Transaction
    2. FIFO Queue
        - Garunteed Order , Low Performance . $$
        - No message duplication
        - 300 Transaction per second ( Batching API can make it go upto 3000 )
        - DQL will also be FIFO

#### FIFO High Throuput

    1. Process up to 9000 tranasction
    2. 90,000 with Batching API

# SNS

    1. Push Based messaging service
    2. Can be usedt to alert a system or a person
    3. One to Many
    4. With the exception of HTTP/S, you can't change Amazon SNS-defined delivery policies

### Quota

    1. Subscribers : Kinesis Data Firehose, SQS , Lambda , email etc
    2. Message size : 256KB
    3. DLQ Support for failed messages
    4. FIFO SNS only supports SQS FIFO queues
    5. Encryption : Default at transit, can add at-rest via AWS KMS
    6. Access Policies for cross-account access.

### SNS Fanout 

    1. Messages published to SNS topics are replicated to multiple subscriptions
    2. Full decoupled parallel async processing

### Message Filtering

    1. JSON policy to filter out messages & determine which message goes to which subscriber.

# API Gateway

    1. Security : WAF - Layer 7 Protection
    2. Stop Abuse : DDoS using WAF
    3. API options - REST API , HTTP , WebSocket API

### Endpoint Type

    1. Edge-Optimized : CloudFront edge
    2. Regional : Region Specific
    3. Private Type : Only access via VPC's.

### Securing API

    1. User Auth
    2. IAM roles , Amazon Cognito , Custom Authorizer
    3. Custom TLS - Through AWS ACM
    4. AWS WAF

# AMAZON MQ

    1. Managed broker service : Supports Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ
    <-- SNS with SQS or AMAZON MQ --> 
    2. SNS with SQS
        - New apps
        - Highly Scalable
        - Public access
    3. AMAZON MQ
        - If migrating exisitng apps
        - Requies Private Network : VPC,VPN..

# AWS STEP FUNCTION

    1. Service orchestration combine diff aws service
    2. Workflows
        - Standard
            - Can run upto 1 full year
            - Rates utp 2,000 executes per second.
        - Express 
            - At-least-once worklow execution
            - Max 5 mins
            - High Event rate workloads
            - Ex : IOT
    3. Different States
        - Pass : no work done
        - Task :
        - Choice :
        - Wait :
        - Succeed : Stopped execution successfully
        - Failed
        - Parallel : 
        - Map : 

# Ingesting data from Saas Apps to AWS with Amazon AppFlow

    1. Amazon AppFlow : 
        - Fully managed Integration server for exchanging data ✅
        - Ingest data and store in S3
        - Bi-directional  ✅
        - Flow ( transfers ) , Data Mapping , Filters , Trigger ( How flow runs )
    2. Use Cases :
        - Transfer salesforce records to Amazon RedShift.
        - Ingesting and analyzing Slack Conversations in S3
