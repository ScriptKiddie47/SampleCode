# Gradle Object Model or Gradle API

### 6 key interfaces

1. Script < Interfaces >  - Implemented by all gradle scripts
2. Project < Interfaces > - Associated with build.gradle file
3. Gradle < Interface >
4. Settings < Interface > - More aligned with Multi-Project
5. Task < Interface >
6. ?

## Sneak Peek into Script < Interfaces >

1. Implemented by all gradle scripts ( File ending in .gradle )
2. https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Script.html#org.gradle.api.Script

3. Lets use the loggin feature offered by SCRIPT API.
4. But first we need to provide an argument for the run configuration

    ![plot](Images/Image5_Gradle.png)

5. Once we run it we get a lot of logs... !

    ```groovy
    logger.info "Hello There!"
    ```
    Output:

    ```
    > Configure project :
    ..
    Hello There!
    ..
    ```
6. Now among the sea of logs, we can finally find our `Hello There!`



## Gradle LifeCycle

1. Initialization Phase
    - During this phase that gradle deteremines which project ( Multi-project ) will take part in the build & creates a project instance of each of the projects.
   - Can maps to one or more file ex : `init.gradle`, `xxx.gradle`,`settings.gradle`
   - Setup initial properties etc etc
2. Configuration Phase 
    - `build.gradle` 
    - the delegate object is the project
3. Execution Phase
    - Actual build is performed. 
    - Tasks & Actions gets perfromed
    - `build.gradle`  


4. Lets look at a example. Say we have 2 files
    
    `sample-project-1/build.gradle`

    ```groovy
    println "From build.gradle"
    println "favNumber : ${gradle.favNumber()}"
    ```
    & `sample-project-1/settings.gradle`

    ```groovy
    println "From settings.gradle"
    gradle.ext.favNumber ={
        return 2
    }
    ```
 
5. Once we run the project we observe : 

    ```
    From settings.gradle
    > Configure project :
    From build.gradle
    favNumber : 2
    > Task :help
    ```
6. Content in settings.gradle is executed before build.gradle as expecteed.

7. For `build.gradle` the `Script <interface>` delegates to `Project <interface>` during the configuration phase. It also depends on the lifecycle.

8. For `settings.gradle` the `Script <interface>` delegates to `Setting <interface>` during the initialization phase. It also depends on the lifecycle.

9. For `init.gradle` the `Script <interface>` delegates to `Gradle <interface>` during the initialization phase. It also depends on the lifecycle. 

10. To top it all off the `Project <interface>` & `Setting <interface>` has access to `Gradle <interface>`. Cool so the above line at point 4 can be written as `println "favNumber : ${project.gradle.favNumber()}"`.

11. Lets see some examaples regarding the gradle object\
    `sample-project-1/settings.gradle`

    ```groovy
    logger.info " >> settings.gradle >> Invoked"
    logger.info " >> settings.gradle >> Gradle Version : ${settings.gradle.gradleVersion}"
    logger.info " >> settings.gradle >> Gradle Version : ${gradle.gradleVersion}"
    ```

    `sample-project-1/build.gradle`

    ```groovy
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Invoked"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> favNumber : ${project.gradle.favNumber()}"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Gradle Version : ${project.gradle.gradleVersion}"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Gradle Version : ${gradle.gradleVersion}"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Gradle Home Directory : ${gradle.gradleHomeDir}"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Gradle User Home Directory : ${gradle.gradleUserHomeDir}"
    ```

    Output:
    ```
     >> settings.gradle >> Invoked
     >> settings.gradle >> Gradle Version : 8.1.1
     >> settings.gradle >> Gradle Version : 8.1.1
    Settings evaluated using settings file '/home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/eclipse-workspace/sample-project-1/settings.gradle'.
    Projects loaded. Root project using build file '/home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/eclipse-workspace/sample-project-1/build.gradle'.
    Included projects: [root project 'sample-project-1']

    > Configure project :
    Evaluating root project 'sample-project-1' using build file '/home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/eclipse-workspace/sample-project-1/build.gradle'.
     >> build.gradle >> Invoked
     >> build.gradle >> favNumber : 2
     >> build.gradle >> Gradle Version : 8.1.1
     >> build.gradle >> Gradle Version : 8.1.1
     >> build.gradle >> Gradle Home Directory : /home/syndicate/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-8.1.1-bin/9wiye5v2saajue4irfo8ybqfp/gradle-8.1.1
     >> build.gradle >> Gradle User Home Directory : /home/syndicate/.gradle
    All projects evaluated.
    ```

12. Lets take a peek at the Project <Interface>. File - `sample-project-1/build.gradle`

    ```groovy
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> build file : $project.buildFile"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> relative path : ${project.relativePath(project.buildFile)}"
    ```

    Output : 

    ```
    >> build.gradle >> build file : /home/syndicate/Documents/CodeSource/eclipse-workspace/sample-project-1/build.gradle
    >> build.gradle >> relative path : build.gradle
    ```

## Gradle Properties

1. Gradle has build in 'properties' on its API objects. These are predefined values. We are already using them 
API. eg : gradleVersion,gradleHomeDir..!

2. Gradle also allows to have a properties file. Its a key-value pair storage. We have access to this file in the `settings.gradle` & `build.gradle` file. The properties file can be present 
    - Project Root Directory : `sample-project-1/gradle.properties`
    - User Home Directory : `/home/syndicate/.gradle/gradle.properties` - Good for storing creds for private repo
    - Command line - https://www.baeldung.com/gradle-command-line-arguments
    - Create an add properties into domain objects in Gradle API - Something we did above - `gradle.ext.favNumber ={return 2}`. Its all thanks to the ext extension that allows properties to be added to existing domain objects.

3. Example : 

    File - `sample-project-1/gradle.properties`
    ```
    springCloudVersion=2
    ```
    File - `sample-project-1/build.gradle`
    ```groovy
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion exists : ${project.hasProperty('springCloudVersion')}"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion exists : ${hasProperty('springCloudVersion')}"

    if(project.hasProperty('springCloudVersion')){
    	logger.info " >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion : $springCloudVersion"
    }
    project.ext.sayHello = "Hello There!"
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> SayHello : $sayHello"
    ```
    Output : 
    ```
    >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion exists : true
    >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion exists : true
    >> build.gradle >> springCloudVersion : 2   
    >> build.gradle >> SayHello : Hello! 
    ```
