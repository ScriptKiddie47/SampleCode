# Gradle Tasks

1. So by now we know that the `build.gradle` references `Project <Interface>`.
2. Our tasks go through 2 phases - Configuration ( define,confige em) &  Execution Phase.
3. So we can deduce that our `Project <Interface>` can contain over 0 to many tasks. It references to `Task <Interface>`.
4. So a project is made up of a collection of tasks. A tasks is made up of a collection of Actions. Reference to Action<Interface>.
5. So how do we go about adding Action objects to Tasks ?
6. `doFirst()` & `doLast()`. These methods accepts a Action/Closue. Since we are using Groovy we will send a closure.
7. Carefully look at the below example

    ```groovy
    logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Invoked"
    defaultTasks 'printName'
    task printName
    project.printName.doLast{
        // Closure Passed
        logger.info " >> build.gradle >> printName.doLast Invoked"
    }
    ```

    Output :

    ```
    > Configure project :
     >> build.gradle >> Invoked
    > Task :printName
     ...
     >> build.gradle >> printName.doLast Invoked
    ```
8. The next example takes a complexity up a notch. 

```groovy
logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Invoked"
defaultTasks 'jobRole'
task jobRole {
	// Configuration of the Closure
	// We are defining the properties here
	description = "Stores Job Role"
	group = "Employee"
	
	doFirst {
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task Name - doFirst : $name"
	}
	
	doLast {
		// Closure
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task Name - doLast : $name"
	}
}

logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Description : ${jobRole.description}"
logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Group : ${jobRole.group}"
```

Output : 

```
> Configure project :
 >> build.gradle >> Invoked
 >> build.gradle >> Description : Stores Job Role
 >> build.gradle >> Group : Employee
> Task :jobRole
 >> build.gradle >> Task Name - doFirst : jobRole
 >> build.gradle >> Task Name - doLast : jobRole

```

9. What is happening above is that we are defining properties of the `task jobRole` such as `description` & `group`. Then we log then , then the task is called - https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/Task.html. We are also logging in task name using $name inside the task configuration closure.

10. Run more than one action in our task. Also take a look on how a task sequences those actions. Also we can access tasks on our project object
