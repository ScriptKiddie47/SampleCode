# Gradle Task Dependencies

## Tasks Sequence

1. Suppose we have multiple tasks , how do we execute them ?
2. Well we can extend the `defaultTasks`

```gradle
defaultTasks 'step1','step2','step3','step4'
task step1{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step2{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step3{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step4{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
```

Output :

```
Tasks to be executed: [task ':step1', task ':step2', task ':step3', task ':step4']
> Task :step1
 >> build.gradle >> Task step1 invoked
> Task :step2
 >> build.gradle >> Task step2 invoked
> Task :step3
 >> build.gradle >> Task step3 invoked
> Task :step4
 >> build.gradle >> Task step4 invoked
```

3. So above we run all the tasks & also see a list of the task. Now this is good but we are hardcoding it. Its not elegant. Lets use a more flexible way. `Gradle allows us to have our tasks depend on other tasks so we can build up a dependency graph of tasks and then gradle works out during the configuration phase which tasks to execute based on the graph order`. One of the many benefits of having a configuration phase.

4. Simple Example using `dependsOn`

```gradle
defaultTasks 'step4'
task step3{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step4 (dependsOn: 'step3' ){
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
```

Output : 

```
Tasks to be executed: [task ':step3', task ':step4']
> Task :step3
 >> build.gradle >> Task step3 invoked
> Task :step4
 >> build.gradle >> Task step4 invoked
```

5. We can extend the `dependsOn` logic to a number of tasks. Such as `task step4 (dependsOn: ['step3','step2'] ){` & this effects the execution order - `Tasks to be executed: [task ':step2', task ':step3', task ':step4']`.

6. What happens when 2 tasks A & B both have a dependency on task C. Does 'C' run twice ? - Nope. Gradle is smart. We can observe this is the tasks graph

7. Taking it a stuff further we can also use a closure instead of hardcoded names used in `dependsOn`. The result of the closure should be single or multiple task objects otherwise we will see an error.

8. Its thanks to `getTasks()` present in `Interface Project` which returns a `Interface TaskContainer`. Within the `Interface TaskContainer` we have a method called `findAll { }` which returns the collection of objects.

9. To get access to `findAll()`. We can use `project.tasks.findAll { }`
10. 

```gradle
task step2{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
logger.info " >> build.gradle >> ${ project.tasks.findAll { task -> task.name.startsWith('step2') } }"	
```

Output :
```
> Configure project :
 >> build.gradle >> [task ':step2']
```

11. We can then extend this further.

```gradle
defaultTasks 'step4'
task step2{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step3{
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
task step4 (dependsOn: ['step3',project.tasks.findAll{task->task.name.startsWith('step2')}]){
	doLast{
		logger.info " >> build.gradle >> Task $name invoked"
	}
}
```

Output 

```
Tasks to be executed: [task ':step2', task ':step3', task ':step4']
```

12. In the above , we could have very well mentioned just `step` instead of `step2` and then this would have fired all the tasks.
