## Numbers

Tree Diagram to Understand\

1. Numbers
    - Real Numbers
        - Rational numbers - $p/q$
            - Integers -   
            - Fractions - 
        - Irrational numbers - $\sqrt{2},\sqrt[3]{2}..$
    - Imaginary Numbers
1. **Natural Numbers** : Positive integers from 1 to infinity - N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}
2. **Whole numbers** : Non-negative integers - W = {0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}
3. **Integers** : Whole numbers but it includes a negative numbers - Z = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}
4. **Real Numbers** : All the positive and negative integers, fractional and decimal numbers without imaginary numbers are called real numbers. Represent by `R`. Numbers which be located in the number.
5. **Rational Numbers** : Any number that can be written as a ratio of one number over another number is written as rational numbers. This means that any number that can be written in the form of p/q. The symbol “Q” represents the rational number - Ex : $1/7$  
6. **Irrational Numbers**: The number that cannot be expressed as the ratio of one over another is known as irrational numbers.Also known as surds. Ex:  $\sqrt{2}$
7. **Complex Numbers** : The number that can be written in the form of a+bi where “a and b” are the real number and “i” is an imaginary number is known as complex numbers “C”.
8. **Imaginary Numbers** : The imaginary numbers are the complex numbers that can be written in the form of the product of a real number and the imaginary unit “i”.
9. **Composite Numbers** : A composite number is a number that has more than two factors. For example, 4 is a composite number, as the number 4 is divisible by 1, 2, and 4. Other examples of composite numbers are 6, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

If we try to calculate the result of \
$1/7 = 0.14285714285$ - Notice repeat of 1428... So there is a pattern here  
$\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237 $ - No Logical pattern visible


## VBOADMAS

1. V = Vinculumn = Bar on Numbers
2. $\overline{3+2} * 5$ ?So first the equation under the file will be calculated.
    - $5*5 = 25$ 

## Modulus

1. Function that indicates distance of one number from another number on the number line.
2. Suppose a statement $|x-3| = 5$. 
    - It indicates that distance between x & 3 is 5.
    - It we take 3 in the numberline then get either x as -2 if we go left 5 times on the number line or 8 if we go right 5 times on the number line. So the answer is (-2,8)
4. Lets take $|x| = 3$. What is x ?
    - We can take the above concept so we can persive the above line as $|x-0|=3$
    - So x can either be (-3,3)
5. $|x+2| = 3$, Find x?
    - We need to consider +2 as -2 in this case. So it will be written as 
    - $|x-(-2)| = 3$ which is ultimately the same as above. But writing like this helps us to accurately find x
    - So -2 on the number line. Go left thrice we get -5 & go right thrice we get 1. So the answer is (-5,1)
6. $|x-3|>2$. Find x ?
    - This is an Inequality so get range for 'x' instead of finite values.
    - So take 3 on the number line. Go left twice & we arrive at 1.Go right twice of 3 & we get 5.
    - But instead of '=' we have '>' now so it means our expected value of x has to be greater or smaller than this. 
    - Solution : $x>5$ & $x<1$
        - Which also can be written as $(-\infty,1)U(5,\infty)$


## Greatest Integer Value / Function ( GIF/GIV )

1. Greatest integer less than or equal to the given value. Ex:
    - $G[3]=3$
    - $G[-3]=-3$
    - $G[2.6]=2$ - First Integer on the left side of number
    - $G[6.99]=6$
    - $G[-2.1]=-3$

## Least Integer Value / Function ( LIF/LIV )

1.Ex:
    - $L[3]=3$
    - $L[-3]=-3$
    - $L[2.6]=3$ - First Integer on the right side of number
    - $L[6.99]=7$
    - $L[-2.1]=-2$
