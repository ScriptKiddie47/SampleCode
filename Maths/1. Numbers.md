## Numbers

Tree Diagram to Understand\

1. Numbers
    - Real Numbers
        - Rational numbers - $p/q$
            - Integers -   
            - Fractions - 
        - Irrational numbers - $\sqrt{2},\sqrt[3]{2}..$
    - Imaginary Numbers
1. **Natural Numbers** : Positive integers from 1 to infinity - N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}
2. **Whole numbers** : Non-negative integers - W = {0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}
3. **Integers** : Whole numbers but it includes a negative numbers - Z = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}
4. **Real Numbers** : All the positive and negative integers, fractional and decimal numbers without imaginary numbers are called real numbers. Represent by `R`. Numbers which be located in the number.
5. **Rational Numbers** : Any number that can be written as a ratio of one number over another number is written as rational numbers. This means that any number that can be written in the form of p/q. The symbol “Q” represents the rational number - Ex : $1/7$  
6. **Irrational Numbers**: The number that cannot be expressed as the ratio of one over another is known as irrational numbers.Also known as surds. Ex:  $\sqrt{2}$
7. **Complex Numbers** : The number that can be written in the form of a+bi where “a and b” are the real number and “i” is an imaginary number is known as complex numbers “C”.
8. **Imaginary Numbers** : The imaginary numbers are the complex numbers that can be written in the form of the product of a real number and the imaginary unit “i”.
9. **Composite Numbers** : A composite number is a number that has more than two factors. For example, 4 is a composite number, as the number 4 is divisible by 1, 2, and 4. Other examples of composite numbers are 6, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

If we try to calculate the result of \
$1/7 = 0.14285714285$ - Notice repeat of 1428... So there is a pattern here  
$\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237 $ - No Logical pattern visible
